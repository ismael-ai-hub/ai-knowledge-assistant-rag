# AI Knowledge Assistant with RAG

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Large Language Models (LLMs).
It allows users to ask questions over their own documents (PDFs or text files) and receive grounded answers
based on retrieved knowledge.

## Features
- Document ingestion (PDF, text)
- Text chunking and embeddings
- Vector database using ChromaDB
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Question answering with source references
- REST API built with FastAPI

## Tech Stack
- Python
- LangChain / LlamaIndex
- OpenAI API or Hugging Face
- ChromaDB
- FastAPI

## Project Status
🚧 In progress — currently implementing document ingestion and vector storage.

## Goals
- Improve factual accuracy and reduce hallucinations
- Explore prompt engineering and retrieval strategies
- Build a modular and maintainable AI system
